# Champion vs Challenger Strategy - Forecast Automation POC

## Overview
This module implements a **Champion vs Challenger** model evaluation strategy to enhance the robustness and adaptability of the Forecast Automation system.

- **Champion**: The currently deployed best model actively serving predictions.
- **Challenger(s)**: New or retrained models that are evaluated against the Champion before being promoted.

The goal is to ensure continuous model improvement without disrupting live services.

## How it Works

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   Live or batch data is fed simultaneously to both Champion and Challenger models.

2. **Prediction Generation**  
   Both models independently generate predictions on the incoming data.

3. **Metrics Collection**  
   Key performance metrics are calculated for both models:
   - RMSE, MAE, MAPE for forecast accuracy
   - Business KPIs (optional)

4. **Performance Comparison**  
   Models are compared over a defined evaluation window based on thresholds (e.g., Challenger must outperform Champion by at least 5%).

5. **Automatic Model Promotion**  
   - If a Challenger consistently outperforms the Champion, it is promoted.
   - Previous Champion is archived for traceability.

6. **Audit Logging**  
   All model switch decisions are logged for future audits and reproducibility.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (prediction and evaluation scripts)
- **MLflow** (optional: model tracking and comparison)
- **Prometheus + Grafana** (optional: real-time monitoring dashboards)
- **PostgreSQL** (metrics storage)
- **FastAPI** or **Flask** (serving models)

## Why Champion vs Challenger?

- Promotes **continuous learning** without immediate risk.
- Reduces **model degradation** over time.
- Ensures that only statistically superior models reach production.
- Adds an additional layer of **governance and quality control** to MLOps.

## Future Enhancements

- Introduce **A/B Testing** for live traffic split evaluation.
- Automate **Canary Deployments** for gradual model rollouts.
- Integrate **Model Explainability (SHAP, LIME)** into promotion criteria.
- Add **Statistical Significance Testing** before promotions.
