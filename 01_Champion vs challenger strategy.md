# Champion vs Challenger Strategy - Forecast Automation POC

Overview - Architecture - Technologies - Challenges (with solutions)

## Overview
This module implements a **Champion vs Challenger** model evaluation strategy to enhance the robustness and adaptability of the Forecast Automation system.

- **Champion**: The currently deployed best model actively serving predictions.
- **Challenger(s)**: New or retrained models that are evaluated against the Champion before being promoted.

The goal is to ensure continuous model improvement without disrupting live services.

## How it Works

1. **Data Ingestion**  : Live or batch data is fed simultaneously to both Champion and Challenger models.

2. **Prediction Generation**  : Both models independently generate predictions on the incoming data.

3. **Metrics Collection**  : Key performance metrics are calculated for both models:
   - RMSE, MAE, MAPE for forecast accuracy
   - Business KPIs (optional)

4. **Performance Comparison**  : Models are compared over a defined evaluation window based on thresholds (e.g., Challenger must outperform Champion by at least 5%).

5. **Automatic Model Promotion**  
   - If a Challenger consistently outperforms the Champion, it is promoted.
   - Previous Champion is archived for traceability.

6. **Audit Logging**  : All model switch decisions are logged for future audits and reproducibility.

## Why Champion vs Challenger?

- Promotes **continuous learning** without immediate risk.
- Reduces **model degradation** over time.
- Ensures that only statistically superior models reach production.
- Adds an additional layer of **governance and quality control** to MLOps.

## Challenging Scenario 1
How to manage different models and their different preprocessing pipelines — especially for champion vs challenger setups?

### **Solution Structure**

| Aspect                        | Strategy                                                         |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Preprocessing Pipelines**   | Treat them as versioned artifacts like models themselves         |
| **Model Management**          | Track model + preprocessing pipeline as a bundle                |
| **Serving/Prediction**        | Use the pipeline associated with each model during inference    |
| **Champion/Challenger Management** | Deploy each bundle separately, route traffic accordingly    |

### **Implementation Pieces**

### 1. Pipeline + Model Bundles ("Model Packages")
- Bundle preprocessing code + model artifact together.
- Store them with a version tag.

**Example Directory Structure:**
```bash
/model_registry/
    /champion_model_v1/
        - model.pkl
        - preprocessing.pkl (or preprocessing.py)
    /challenger_model_v2/
        - model.pkl
        - preprocessing.pkl
```


### 2. Model Registry
Use a registry like MLflow, SageMaker Model Registry, or custom DB.

Each registry entry includes:

Model binary

Preprocessing object/code

Metadata (hyperparameters, training dataset id, metrics)

### 3. Dynamic Loading at Serving Time
When serving predictions:

Identify which model is handling the request (Champion or Challenger).

Load that model’s own preprocessing pipeline.

Apply preprocessing → predict.

No assumptions that preprocessing is shared!

✅ Inference flow =
raw input → model-specific preprocessing → model inference → postprocessing (optional)

### 4. Champion-Challenger Routing (Use case specific)
Traffic Splitting:

90% of requests → Champion model pipeline

10% of requests → Challenger model pipeline

Compare metrics live (A/B testing style).

If Challenger beats Champion → promote.

Managed via:

 - API Gateway routing rules

 - Model server configurations

 - Tools like Seldon Core / KFServing / AWS SageMaker Inference Pipelines
